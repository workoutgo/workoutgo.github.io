Choose a type of cardio that you enjoy the most. Add the total rmr to the calories burned during exercise. All of these movements allow you to move heavy weights and overload the muscles without performing endless exercises. Effective fat loss workouts are generally energy depleting and physically and mentally taxing and best paired with a nutritional plan of attack that’s filled with healthy, whole foods (no processed, fast food crap), which leaves you in a slight calorie deficit to lose weight.
