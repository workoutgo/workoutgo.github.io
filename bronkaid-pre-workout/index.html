<p>Not saying that bronkaid is harmful, just the logic and reasoning people have sometimes is just so wrong. I started on friday doing the following (1 of each component 3 times daily, one of those times being prior to a workout) 1 tablet of bronkaid, with 25mg of ephedrine sulfate per tablet. My question is would it be ok to take the second bronkaid pre workout along with my preworkout. I find that if i take 25mg of ephedrine before a workout, i won't get tired at all.
