The purpose of our study was to compare strength gains after 12 weeks of nonperiodized (np), linear periodized (lp), and nonlinear periodized (nlp) resistance training models using split. Kraemer, human kinetics, 2007, pp. The purpose of our study was to compare strength gains after 12 weeks of nonperiodized (np), linear periodized (lp), and nonlinear periodized (nlp). The strength training strategy of linear periodization has long been recognized as an efficient system of resistance training.

<p>Periodization of resistance training or planned changes in training volume and intensity are used to maximize strength and fitness gains. This is a program concept that varies training specificity, intensity, and volume in each microcycle. It defines and explains how nonlinear periodization works and then demonstrates how to create nonlinear periodization training programmes. Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve strength and endurance. Ch22 (488 503).</p>
