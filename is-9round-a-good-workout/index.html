<p>From the challenge of the week (chow) to the hiit training approach to the integration of heart rate training, everything about 9round is designed by certified fitness experts and champion kickboxers to unlock the potential of anyone willing to show up. For example, you can be kicking a horizontal bag for 20 seconds followed by a set of squat jumps or lunges with extra weight. I definitely recommend taking the first free workout (or more free if they offer) so you can see if you like the trainers and it. Every workout is designed by experts.</p>
