<p>Today we pay respects and acknowledge the passing away of paul quadzilla demayo who passed away on this day back in 2005 in boston from a heroin overdose. It is extremely unfortunate for the bodybuilding world that paul died on june 2. Every leg workout for me was squat. In fact, i may go as far to say that jay, ronnie, kai and dorian's legs were/are on par with demayo and platz's, but platz's and demayo's legs stand out much more because they overpower their upper bodies so much.
