The mtren is very toxic and is for powerlifting days or days you want to seriously lift heavy weights from what i been told. Did you guys who ran mtren pre workout get real gains from it or is it really in and out of the system too quickly. Ya i would usually use it like 45 min pre workout. I have only ever taken 0.5 ml 30 mins before working out.

<p>Ok guys, i have only 1 vial of both injectable m1t and injectable mtren from dexter. That was my point and why i put it in quotations lol. Did you guys who ran mtren pre workout get real gains from it or is it really in and out of the system too quickly. So you decide to take it pre workout only. Picture: Mtren.</p>
