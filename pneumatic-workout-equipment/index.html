<p>Keiser's unique pneumatic resistance system allows for training at speed, and provides the appropriate workout for any client or club member. They called it the leaper, but he doesn't remember if that was the actual name. Conventional exercise methods require heavy weights and frequent switching of weights over the course of a workout.

<p>If you explode upwards, pushing the weight as hard as you can, the exercise would be easier than if you tried to slowly raise the bar above your head. Like most other iron horse training equipment, each component is part of an individual module. With pneumatic resistance, the resistance is constantly the same, no matter how. The difference to regular weights or exercise equipment is that the weight stacks, wires and other moving parts are replaced with a pneumatic cylinder  whose resistance can be adjusted with air pressure.
