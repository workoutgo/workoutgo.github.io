<p>According to simmons, sled dragging can be used on almost any training day because the nature of the exercise prevents the excessive soreness seen after exercises with a heavy eccentric component. For races up to 10,000 meters one can pull a weight sled for 30 minutes or just over the world record for that length race. Not only that, it is a low impact exercise that actually decompresses the spine as you walk making it also an effective rehab. I got some great insights about sleds studying of one louie simmons’ books. LOUIE SIMMONS ultrasamiec alfa silniejszy od stali Zen Jaskiniowca.</p>
