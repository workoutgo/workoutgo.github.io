Insanity and Focus T25 comparison chart BeachBody FocusT25 Pinterest From pinterest.com
Insanity to me, is way more intense than t25. Like other beachbody fitness programs, focus t25 includes an ab centered workout as well. The first and most obvious distinction between focus t25 and insanity is the duration of the workouts. T25 is a 10 week program while insanity is 2 months which really isn’t that big of deal.
