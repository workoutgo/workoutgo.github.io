Metabolic Syndrome Effects Model Anatomy Models and Anatomical Charts From shopanatomical.com
For a variable period of time, at least several hours, your metabolic rate is increased due to the intensity of your training. Perform as many reps as possible of each exercise for 60 seconds followed by a 15 seconds rest one after the other with no rest in between. There’s research showing that shorter, intense workouts burn more fat than working out at a moderate intensity for a longer period of time, for example, running on a treadmill at a steady pace for 30 minutes or more. Metabolic aftershock is a dvd set containing weight loss exercises and routines to boost your bodies ability for weight loss.
