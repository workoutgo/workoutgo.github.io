If you have decided to do full body workouts, there are only a handful exercises you need to do. So after that first day it&#39;s fine to do back, hamstrings, core, overhead, upper traps, rear delts, grip work etc to avoid working the same muscle twice. Each day you will work a different body part. Complete 5 reps and increase each set by 10 pounds (5 pounds per arm) until you can no longer compete 5 reps with a weight.
