Mark McMorris Team Canada Official Olympic Team Website From olympic.ca
Mcmorris beat out seppe smitts, eric willet, seb toots, and torstien horgmo in the finals to take the top spot in the big air. He had done the jump earlier and knew he had to veer to the right to avoid a cluster of trees, but instead he spun to the left and crashed into the trees. Strong glutes mean more power, so mcmorris’ training involves lots and lots (and lots) of squats. Strung collectively, they make for a fast exercise curated by among the world’s most elite athletes — good to squeeze in throughout industrial breaks!
